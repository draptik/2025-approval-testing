# README

Demo solution illustrating features of the [Verify](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify) testing framework.

- To keep dependencies organized, `Directory.[Build|Packages].props` files are used to define common properties.
- This solution uses dotnet8 (see [global.json](./global.json)). Most features should also work older versions, but YMMV.
